# Module 4: Data Analysis with Pandas

## Overview

In this module, you'll dive into Pandas, a Python library for high-performance data analysis. You'll use Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze datasets, inspect and clean data, merge datasets, and create insightful visualizations with Pandas.

The module introduces concepts like DataFrames, data manipulation, and data cleaning, which are essential for advanced analytics. You'll learn how to derive insights from data using efficient Pandas methods and techniques.

## Key Concepts

- Introduction to Pandas and Jupyter
  - Learn to work with Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebook.
  - Run functions on DataFrames and read/write data to/from CSV files.

- Exploring Pandas
  - Navigate through rows and columns using `loc` and `iloc`.
  - Filter and slice data to create subsets.
  - Use the `groupby` method for aggregations and sorting.

- Merging and Data Cleaning
  - Merge datasets effectively.
  - Use the `cut` method to bin data and derive new values.
  - Fix bugs in Pandas workflows.

## Assignment: District and School Analysis

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, you'll create a comprehensive report analyzing school district data. Your report will include:

1. **District Summary**:
   - Total number of unique schools.
   - Total students and budget.
   - Average math and reading scores.
   - Percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall.

2. **School Summary**:
   - Key metrics per school (e.g., name, type, total students, budgets, scores, etc.).
   - Percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall.

3. **Top/Bottom Schools by Passing Rate**:
   - Identify top and bottom-performing schools.

4. **Scores by Grade, Spending, Size, and Type**:
   - Create tables breaking down performance by grades, spending ranges, school sizes, and school types.

## Instructions

- Use Pandas methods to perform calculations and create the required DataFrames.
- Use grouping and sorting techniques to derive insights.
- Perform data cleaning to ensure accuracy in results.
- Write Python code for data analysis and presentation within the Jupyter Notebook.

### Skills Gained

- Manipulating datasets using Pandas.
- Performing advanced calculations like groupings and aggregations.
- Building professional-grade data analysis workflows.
- Developing reports from structured datasets.

## Deliverables

- A fully functional Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- A detailed summary highlighting at least two trends observed in the dataset.
